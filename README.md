# Rational Arithmetic Evaluation
程式語言設計 final project

## 實作內容
- Able to do add/subtract/multiply/divide computations on rational numbers.
- Print the result in simplified form
- Store rational number as two integers(numerator and denominator) instead of float numbers.
## Example
- `(1%2) + (3%4) * (5%6) - (2%1) / (1%2)` will evaluates to `(-23) % 8` where `(a%b)` means `a/b`    
- `(1%1) / (2%0)` will report a “divide by zero” error
